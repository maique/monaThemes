# monaThemes

Some themes I've created for the [Mona](https://mastodon.social/@MonaApp) Mastodon client.

Mona is a great Mastodon client, full featured, with endless tweaking possibilities. One of the coolest features, as far as I'm concerned, is the theme section. You can easily create new themes, or import one made by someone else.

So, I went ahead and made a few.
