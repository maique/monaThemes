[Mona](https://mastodon.social/@MonaApp) is a great Mastodon client. 

Full featured, with endless tweaking possibilities. One of the coolest features, as far as I'm concerned, is the theme section. You can easily create new themes, or import ones made by someone else. It's a ton of fun.

So, I went ahead and made a few.

Note: none of the themes follow the original theme's guidelines. I just threw the colors where I thought they looked good. 

## maiqueNokai

Based on [Monokai](https://monokai.pro), with a sprinkle of [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com), this was the first one on my list. I wanted to have a go at theme making, and this is want I wanted for a theme.

## macchiato

Based on the Macchiato flavor of [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin), this one quickly became my favorite, and it's now what I'm using most of the time.

## Gruvbox

[Gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) is a cool retro theme, and I love cool retro themes. Hence, this one was a natural port.

#### How to Install

You can read the QR Codes if you're reading this on your computer, or save them to your Camera Roll and let iOS do the rest, if you're on your phone.

Another way to do it is copying the mona-cat link you'll find on the theme's description, and paste that into Safari. It should prompt you to open Mona, and the theme will be installed.

#### Notes

A lot more great themes by other authors can be found on [this thread on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@MonaApp/109859984571889210). I'm sure you'll find something that you like, plenty of cool ones over there. 

Or, maybe you do one, and share it with the rest of us? That would be awesome!
